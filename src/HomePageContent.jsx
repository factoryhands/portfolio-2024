        Iâ€™m a multi-discipline designer with over a decade of experience. My
        design origin-story begins in the physical realm where I designed
        apparel and fitness wear.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current domain is more ephemeral, designing experiences for
        digital products. I am currently a product designer at Repl.it.

        I live in Seattle, Washington with my cat Lilith. I love to bike and
        am a first responder with King County ESAR. You can read more about
